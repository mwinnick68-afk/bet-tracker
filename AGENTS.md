# Bet Tracker — Codex Working Agreement

## Goal
A small Python data project that logs bets and outputs accurate summaries/reports.

## How to work (must follow)
1) Explain the plan in 3–5 bullets before coding.
2) Make the smallest change possible per task.
3) After coding: summarize what changed and why (teach me).
4) Add/adjust tests when logic changes.
5) Run lint + tests before finishing.

## Commands
- Lint: ruff check .
- Tests: pytest -q

## Safety
- Never commit secrets/tokens.
- Keep real personal data out of Git; use sample files when sharing.
